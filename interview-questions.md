# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX? 

Your answer: JSX is a javascript library that allows us to display HTML within a javascript application. One syntax difference between HTML and JSX is with JSX you must enclose your code in <> and </>. We used JSX a lot with React to allow us to display and change data on a page or app.

Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension of Javascript that allows us to input HTML directly into React. 

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: YARN stands for 'yet another resource node'... or at least I think it's node. It's a package manager. We use it to download packages of files that help make coding easier or for things like JEST that we use to test our code. I'm not sure what files are modified when you run yarn though. 

Researched answer: YARN stands for 'Yet Another Resource Negotiator'. We use YARN to create the file structure of a React app. It modifies files in the src folder of our app. 

3. What is a React component? 

Your answer: A React component It is a single self contained bit of code that does a function or displays information. 

Researched answer: React components are independant and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. 

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State Values are the values in React Components that contatain data or information, kind of like a variable in JavaScript. Props are properties that can be passed between react components.

Researched answer: State is the local state of the component which can't be accessed or modified outside of the component. Props make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent components. 

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: I can't remember what it stands for but I know this has to do with updating single bits of information on a page instead of updating the entire page. 

Researched answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is always listening for changes. An example of this would be the onClick attribute to a button, the DOM is listening for the click and will perform the prescribed action once it 'hears' the click.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: Hmm div is just a division or a section of an HTML page, I'm guessing a span is kinda similar although I don't know how. 

Researched answer: Span and div are both generic HTML elements that group together related parts of a web page. Div elements are used for block-level organization. Span elements are used for inline organization and styling.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: A computer programing model that organizes software design around data, or object, rather than functions and logic

2. Ruby: Used for building servers and data processing, web svcraping, and crawling

3. Implicit return: When your code returns a value without you adding 'return'

4. Ruby blocks: Little anonymous functions that can be passed into methods

5. Ruby hashes: Data structures used to store data in the form of unique key-value pairs. Kind of like an array, but there is no index.
